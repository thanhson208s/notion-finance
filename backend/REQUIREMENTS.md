# Requirements — Notion Finance Backend

Personal finance management backend. Serves as the API layer for a React web application,
using Notion as the database and AWS Lambda as the compute layer.

---

## System Architecture

```
CloudFront (finance.gootube.online)
  ├── /api/*  →  Lambda Function URL (AWS IAM auth)  →  Notion API
  └── /*      →  Vercel (React frontend)
```

- **CloudFront**: Origin Access Control (sigv4); routes `/api/*` to Lambda and all other paths to Vercel
- **Lambda**: `AWS_IAM` authorization; only callable via CloudFront (resource policy)
- **Notion API**: Acts as the sole database layer — tables are created via the Notion UI; the backend only queries and updates records
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript, deployed on Vercel

Full infrastructure details: see [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md)

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) |
| Runtime | AWS Lambda (Node.js 20.x) |
| Deployment | Serverless Framework v4 |
| Database | Notion (via `@notionhq/client`) |
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite (separate repo) |

---

## Database Schema

Four Notion databases. Full schema with property names and types: [`docs/database-schema.md`](./docs/database-schema.md)

| Database | Key Fields |
|---|---|
| **Account** | `id`, `name`, `balance` (Number), `type` (Select) |
| **Category** | `id`, `name`, `type` (Select: Income/Expense/Financial), `parentId` (Relation, self-referential) |
| **Transaction** | `id`, `timestamp` (Date), `amount` (Number), `fromAccount` (Relation), `toAccount` (Relation), `category` (Relation), `note` (Text), `linkedCard` (Relation) |
| **Card** | `id`, `name`, `annualFee` (Number), `linkedAccount` (Relation) |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Latency** | Lambda timeout: 60 seconds (Notion API can be slow) |
| **Security** | All Lambda invocations signed with AWS Signature V4 via CloudFront OAC |
| **Timezone** | All timestamps stored in `Asia/Bangkok` (UTC+7) |
| **Currency** | Primary currency: VND |
| **Error handling** | All errors mapped to structured HTTP responses with `code` and `message` |
| **Testing** | Unit tests configured with Vitest — 69 tests passing (v1.2.0) |
